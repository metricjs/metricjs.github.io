# metricjs.github.io

My personal home page and blog, powered by Jekyll. I intend to use it to practice:

- templating
- abstraction
- SEO

This will probably be a work in progress for a fair while, but it's all a learning experience.

## Dev notes

- `bundle install` after cloning
- `jekyll serve` to run local server?
